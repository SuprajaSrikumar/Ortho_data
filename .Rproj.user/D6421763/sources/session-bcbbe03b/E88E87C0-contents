```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```


## Loading data

```{r}
ortho_data <- read_csv(here("Data", "2025_03_31_ortho_data_SS.csv"))
```

## Creating variable for total trials and at least 12 accurate trials

```{r}

# Step 1: Compute accuracy per trial (e.g., treat a trial as "correct" if all rows are correct)

trial_accuracy <- ortho_data %>%
  group_by(RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL, TRIAL_INDEX) %>%
  summarise(
    trial_correct = any(Accuracy == "Correct"),
      .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 2: Count how many trials were accurate per subject

subject_summary <- trial_accuracy %>%
  group_by(RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL) %>%
  summarise(
    total_trials = n(),
    accurate_trials = sum(trial_correct),
    at_least_12_accurate = accurate_trials >= 12,
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 3: Join this back to your original eye tracking data
ortho_data <- ortho_data %>%
  left_join(subject_summary %>% select(RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL, accurate_trials, at_least_12_accurate), by = "RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL")
