```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```


## Loading data

```{r}
ortho_data <- read_csv(here("Data", "2025_03_31_ortho_data_SS.csv"))
```

## Creating variable that indicated if participant looked at all four interest areas

```{r}
# Step 1: Summarize whether each IA had fixation > 0
trial_ia_summary <- ortho_data %>%
  group_by(RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL, TRIAL_INDEX, IA_LABEL) %>%
  summarise(
    fixated = any(IA_FIXATION_COUNT > 0, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 2: Count how many IAs were fixated per trial
trial_all_four_ia <- trial_ia_summary %>%
  group_by(RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL, TRIAL_INDEX) %>%
  summarise(
    unique_IAs_fixated = sum(fixated),
    looked_all_four_IA = as.integer(unique_IAs_fixated == 4),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 3: Join back to main data
ortho_data <- ortho_data %>%
  left_join(trial_all_four_ia %>% select(RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL, TRIAL_INDEX, looked_all_four_IA),
            by = c("RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL", "TRIAL_INDEX"))
```


## Creating variable for total trials and at least 12 accurate trials

```{r}
# Step 1: Create accuracy_high_low variable
ortho_data <- ortho_data %>%
  mutate(
    accuracy_high_low = as.integer(Response_Choice %in% c("High_Ortho", "Low_Ortho"))
  )
# Step 2: Compute accuracy per trial (e.g., treat a trial as "correct" if all rows are correct)

trial_accuracy <- ortho_data %>%
  group_by(RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL, TRIAL_INDEX) %>%
  summarise(
    trial_correct = as.integer(any(accuracy_high_low == 1, na.rm = TRUE)),
      .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 2: Count how many trials were accurate per subject

subject_summary <- trial_accuracy %>%
  group_by(RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL) %>%
  summarise(
    total_trials = n(),
    accurate_trials = sum(trial_correct),
    at_least_12_accurate = accurate_trials >= 12,
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 3: Join this back to your original eye tracking data
ortho_data <- ortho_data %>%
  left_join(subject_summary %>% select(RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL, accurate_trials, at_least_12_accurate), by = "RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL")

```

## Adding Good Trials variable

```{r}

# Step 1: Mark "good" trials per subject-trial
good_trials <- ortho_data %>%
  group_by(RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL, TRIAL_INDEX) %>%
  summarise(
    trial_correct = any(Response_Choice %in% c("High_Ortho", "Low_Ortho"), na.rm = TRUE),
    fixated_all_four = any(looked_all_four_IA == 1, na.rm = TRUE),
    good_trial = as.integer(trial_correct & fixated_all_four),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 2: Compute subject-level good_trial_count and flag
good_trial_summary <- good_trials %>%
  group_by(RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL) %>%
  summarise(
    good_trial_count = sum(good_trial),
    has_12_good_trials = as.integer(good_trial_count >= 12),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
# Step 3: Join back to your original data
ortho_data <- ortho_data %>%
  left_join(good_trial_summary, by = "RECORDING_SESSION_LABEL")
```

## Extracting Data

```{r}
write_csv(ortho_data, "2025_04_02_Ortho_Data_variables_added.csv")
```
